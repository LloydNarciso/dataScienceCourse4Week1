## Readme for Course 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis) of John Hopkins Data Science Coursera Track/Week 1

This repository contains 4 R-scripts; each one creates one of 4 plots based on the data assigned by the course project. A user will be able to recreate the plot by directly sourcing the R-script. The repository also contains the resulting 4 .PNG plots, which should match the output in the assignment.

### Data
This assignment uses data from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”.

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]
* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

1. <b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. <b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. <b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. <b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. <b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. <b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. <b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. <b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. <b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
